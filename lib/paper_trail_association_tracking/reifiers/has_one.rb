      # A more helpful error message, instead of the AssociationTypeMismatch
      # you would get if, eg. we were to try to assign a Bicycle to the :car
      # association (before, if there were multiple records we would just take
      # the first and hope for the best).

        MESSAGE_FMT = <<~STR
          Unable to reify has_one association. Expected to find one %s,
          but found %d.

          This is a known issue, and a good example of why association tracking
          is an experimental feature that should not be used in production.

          That said, this is a rare error. In spec/models/person_spec.rb we
          reproduce it by having two STI models with the same foreign_key (Car
          and Bicycle are both Vehicles and the FK for both is owner_id)

          If you'd like to help fix this error, please read
          https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/594
          and see spec/models/person_spec.rb
